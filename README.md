##Game Rules
###3x3
The game is played with 2 players, one plays as __X__ while the other plays as __O__. The players take turns playing
their letter until the board is filled, or a someone wins. A player wins by getting three in a row, either 
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 

###9x9
This version starts with similar setup, but the board is a __3x3 of 3x3s__, and the goal is to get a line of 3 
complete 3x3 game boards. After one players turn, the other play must play in the 3x3 box relative to the small
box play in by the last player. The play starts in the middle 3x3, and if the 3x3 to be played in is already 
complete, then that player must choose a box.

###27x27 (TBA)
